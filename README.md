# Jani.jl: ANI Neural Networks in Julia

## Description
Jani.jl is a complete Julia rewrite of the well-known PyTorch ANI package, implementing Atomic Neural Networks for simulating molecular dynamics and chemical properties. This tool's migration to the Julia programming environment is motivated by leveraging Julia's remarkable performance and efficiency, especially in numerical and parallel computations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Julia (version 1.6 or higher) installed on your system.

### Installing Jani.jl
Jani.jl is currently under development and will be registered with the Julia General Registry soon.
